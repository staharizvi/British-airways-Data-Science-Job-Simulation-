## Overview

This repository includes implementations of practical data science tasks completed during the job simulation. The tasks focus on using Python for data analysis, web scraping, and machine learning to gain company insights and predict customer buying behavior.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights
- Implemented web scraping techniques to extract relevant data from various online sources.
- Processed and analyzed the scraped data to derive actionable insights.

### 2. Predicting Customer Buying Behavior
- Developed machine learning models to predict customer buying behavior based on historical data.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics and improved the models through iterative tuning.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- BeautifulSoup4
- Requests
